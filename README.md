# README Generator by Captain Flint
            
## Description
    
This app is designed to generate a high-quality README for a given project. It does this by using inquirer to gather user input about their app, and to then integrate it into professional README markup. Through the process of building this app I learned about node.js functionality and specifally how to use packages such as inquirer to provide an interactive experience between a user and my application.
